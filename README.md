# Sticky Offerpack

This is an example of sticky block inside other block, that centered by screen, but should not be overflowing from container.

## Dependencies

- [react-stickynode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-stickynode) to make block sticky
- [lodash.throttle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.throttle) to throttle window vertical resize
- [normalize.css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/normalize.css) to remove some unnecessary default styles

## TODO

- [x] Reset block position in first offerpack, when page scrolled to top
